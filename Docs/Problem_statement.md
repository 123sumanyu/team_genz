### `Problem Statement`

In current farming practices, pesticide application is mostly carried out using uniform spraying techniques, where chemicals are applied across entire fields without identifying which plants actually need treatment. This approach results in excessive pesticide usage, higher farming costs, and long-term damage to soil health and the surrounding environment. Healthy plants are often sprayed unnecessarily, while infected plants may not receive timely or appropriate treatment.

Farmers largely depend on manual inspection to identify crop infections, which is time-consuming, labor-intensive, and difficult to manage in large or row-based farms. Due to human limitations and delayed observation, early-stage infections are frequently missed, allowing diseases to spread and reduce overall crop yield.

Existing spraying systems and agricultural machines primarily focus on coverage rather than precision. Many available solutions are expensive, complex to operate, and designed for large-scale farming, making them unsuitable for small and medium-scale farmers. Additionally, most systems do not provide meaningful feedback or monitoring support to farmers, limiting their ability to make informed decisions.

There is a clear need for a cost-effective and practical pesticide application solution that focuses on selective treatment, minimizes chemical wastage, supports soil health, and provides farmers with better visibility into crop conditions. Addressing these challenges is essential to improve farming efficiency, reduce environmental impact, and support sustainable agricultural practices.
