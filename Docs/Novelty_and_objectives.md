# Novelty and Objectives

### `Novelty of the Proposed System`

The proposed system introduces a practical and field-oriented approach to pesticide application by focusing on selective treatment rather than blanket spraying. Unlike conventional methods that treat all plants equally, this system is designed to act only where intervention is actually required, helping reduce chemical overuse and unnecessary exposure.

A key novel aspect of the system is its ability to distinguish between different levels of plant infection and apply treatment accordingly. This ensures that mild cases are not over-treated and severe cases receive appropriate attention, which is not commonly addressed in existing spraying systems.

Another important novelty lies in the integration of soil condition monitoring alongside crop treatment. By considering soil parameters during operation, the system supports healthier long-term farming practices rather than short-term chemical dependency.

The system is also designed with affordability and simplicity in mind. Its lightweight structure, use of commonly available components, and ease of operation make it suitable for small and medium-scale farmers, unlike many existing solutions that are costly and complex.

Finally, the inclusion of farmer-oriented monitoring and status updates adds practical value by keeping users informed about crop and soil conditions, enabling better decision-making without requiring advanced technical knowledge.

### `Objectives of the Project`

The primary objective of this project is to develop a pesticide application system that reduces chemical wastage by treating only infected plants instead of spraying entire fields. This approach aims to improve crop health while minimizing environmental impact.

Another objective is to support early identification and appropriate treatment of plant infections, helping farmers take timely action before diseases spread further. By applying the right amount of treatment at the right place, the system seeks to improve overall farm productivity.

The project also seeks to advance sustainable farming practices through the implementation of soil condition monitoring, enabling farmers to preserve soil health while effectively managing crop diseases

Cost-effectiveness and ease of use are key objectives of the system. The project is designed to be affordable, easy to operate, and suitable for real-world farming environments without requiring specialized skills.

Overall, the objective is to provide farmers with a reliable, practical, and farmer-friendly solution that improves efficiency, reduces effort, and supports long-term agricultural sustainability.
