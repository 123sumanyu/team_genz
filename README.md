# Intelligent Pesticide Sprinkler with Infection Severity Detection

---

## Overview

This project presents a smart and practical approach to pesticide application in agriculture. The system is designed to reduced unnecessary chemical usage by applying pesticides only where required, instead of spraying entire fields uniformly. It focuses on selective treatment, better resource utilization, and improved support for farmers in managing crop health.

The solution is implemented as a mobile system capable of navigating row-based farms, monitoring crop and soil conditions, and performing controlled pesticide spraying based on plant health observations.

## Problem Statement

In traditional farming practices, pesticides are commonly sprayed across entire fields without identifying which plantsactually require treatment. This leads to excessive chemical usage, higher costs, environmental damage, and long-term soil degradation. Manual inspection of crops is time-consuming and often fails to detect early-stage infections, especially in large farms.

Existing spraying systems focus more on coverage than precision and are often expensive, complex, and unsuitable for small and medium-scale farmers. There is a need for a cost-effective and practical solution that enables selective treatment, reduces chemical wastage, and supports sustainable farming.

## Proposed Solution

The proposed system introduces a selective pesticide spraying mechanism supported by crop observation and soil monitoring. The system operates on a mobile platform that moves through crop rows, observes plant conditions, and activates spraying only when treatment is required.

By avoiding uniform spraying and focusing on targeted application, the system helps reduce pesticide overuse, protect healthy plants, and improve overall farm efficiency. The collected field data can also be shared with farmers to improve awareness and decision-making.
