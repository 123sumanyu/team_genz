# Round 2 – Planned Enhancements and Full System Development

---

## Objective of Round 2

The goal of Round 2 is to expands  the current working prototype into a complete, end-to-end farming support system. While the initial phase focuses on selective pesticide spraying using a mobile platform, the next round aims to provide farmers with a full software ecosystem that includes monitoring, control, and data-driven decision support.

---

## Mobile Application Development

In the next round, a dedicated mobile application will be developed to act as the primary interface for farmers.

Planned features of the mobile application include:
- Dashboard displaying crop condition summary  
- Soil condition reports and historical trends  
- System status and operational updates  
- Alerts and notifications for required intervention  
- Overview of treated and untreated crop areas  

The application will be designed with simplicity in mind so that farmers can easily understand and use it without technical proficiency.

## Backend and Data Management

To support the mobile application and long-term monitoring, a backend system will be introduced.

Planned backend features:
- Centralized data storage for crop and soil records  
- Secure communication between field system and user interface  
- User-based access for different farms or locations  
- Data logging for analysis and reporting  

This backend layer will allow structured data handling and future expansion of system capabilities.

## System Monitoring and Control

Round 2 will also focus on improving system visibility and control.

Planned improvements include:
- Live system status monitoring  
- Error detection and basic fault alerts  
- Manual override options through the app  
- Activity logs for spraying and movement  

These features will help farmers better understand system behavior and respond quickly if issues arise.

---

## Hardware and Integration Improvements

The existing hardware platform will be refined for better reliability and field performance.

Planned improvements:
- Improved power efficiency and battery management  
- Better enclosure and weather protection  
- Cleaner wiring and modular hardware layout  
- Enhanced sensor placement for improved readings  

These changes aim to improve durability and usability in real farming conditions.

---

## Scalability and Expansion

The Round 2 system will be designed to support future scalability.

Planned expansion capabilities:
- Support for multiple fields or plots  
- Ability to handle more sensors and devices  
- Preparation for additional crop types  
- Modular software design for easy upgrades  

This ensures the solution can grow beyond a single prototype deployment.

---

## Expected Outcome

By the end of Round 2, the project aims to deliver:
- A complete working system with hardware and software integration  
- A farmer-friendly mobile application  
- Reliable data monitoring and reporting  
- A scalable foundation for future development  

The Round 2 implementation will move the project closer to real-world usability and long-term adoption in agricultural environments.

---

## Conclusion

Round 2 focuses on transforming the current prototype into a complete and practical solution. By adding monitoring, data management, and user interaction layers, the project aims to provide farmers with better control, visibility, and confidence in managing crop health efficiently and sustainably.
