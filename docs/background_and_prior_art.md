Background and Prior Art
Background of the Problem
Agriculture has always depended heavily on chemical pesticides to protect crops from diseases and pests. In most farming practices, pesticides are applied uniformly across entire fields without considering whether all plants are infected or not. This blanket spraying approach results in excessive use of chemicals, increased farming costs, and long-term damage to soil quality and surrounding ecosystems.

Farmers often rely on manual inspection to identify infected plants, which is time-consuming, labor-intensive, and prone to human error—especially in large or row-based farms. In many cases, early-stage infections go unnoticed, while healthy plants are sprayed unnecessarily. This not only reduces crop yield but also leads to health risks for farmers due to prolonged exposure to harmful chemicals.

Another major challenge is the lack of real-time feedback. Farmers usually do not receive timely information about crop health conditions or soil status, making it difficult to take preventive measures. As a result, pesticide application is reactive rather than preventive, leading to higher losses and lower return on investment.

Existing Solutions and Limitations
Several solutions have been developed to address inefficiencies in pesticide application. Traditional mechanical sprayers and tractor-mounted systems help reduce manual effort but still operate on uniform spraying logic. These systems cannot differentiate between healthy and infected plants.

Some advanced systems use basic sensors or camera-based detection to identify diseased plants. While these solutions improve accuracy compared to manual methods, most of them only detect the presence of disease and do not evaluate the extent or severity of infection. As a result, the same pesticide treatment is applied regardless of whether the infection is minor or severe.

In addition, many existing systems are bulky, expensive, and designed for large-scale industrial farming. Their high cost and complex maintenance make them unsuitable for small and medium-scale farmers. Most solutions also lack integration with soil monitoring or farmer-facing applications, limiting their usefulness in real-world decision-making.

Closest Prior Art
One notable prior system is a camera-based agricultural robot developed by academic institutions for automated pesticide spraying. This system is capable of navigating farm terrain and identifying infected crops for spraying. However, it does not differentiate between levels of infection and applies pesticides in a generalized manner.

Other prior inventions focus on sensor-based spraying mechanisms or mobile pesticide robots. While these systems improve efficiency and reduce manual labor, they lack selective treatment logic and do not consider soil health parameters. Furthermore, many such systems operate as standalone machines without providing meaningful feedback or data access to farmers.

Identified Gaps
Based on the review of existing agricultural practices and available pesticide spraying systems, several key gaps can be identified. Most current methods rely on uniform pesticide spraying without considering the actual condition or severity of infection in individual plants, which leads to unnecessary chemical usage on healthy crops. There is also limited focus on monitoring soil health during the spraying process, even though soil quality directly affects crop growth and long-term farm productivity. In addition, many existing solutions are costly, complex to operate, and difficult to maintain, making them impractical for small and medium-scale farmers. The absence of farmer-oriented monitoring and feedback further reduces their effectiveness, as farmers do not receive timely or actionable information to support better decision-making. These gaps highlight the need for a more precise, affordable, and farmer-friendly pesticide application approach that promotes selective treatment and sustainable farming practices.
