# Background and Prior Art

### `Background`

In current agricultural practices, pesticide application is largely carried out using uniform spraying methods across entire fields. This approach does not consider whether all plants require treatment, leading to excessive use of chemicals. As a result, healthy plants are exposed unnecessarily, soil quality degrades over time, and farming costs increase. Farmers are also exposed to health risks due to repeated contact with chemical pesticides.

Crop inspection is mostly performed manually, which becomes difficult and inefficient in large or row-based farms. Visual inspection is time-consuming and often fails to identify infections at an early stage, allowing diseases to spread before corrective action is taken. This delay directly affects crop yield and overall farm productivity.

Another limitation of traditional practices is the lack of real-time crop and soil feedback. Farmers typically make decisions based on past experience rather than live field data, which makes pesticide application reactive instead of preventive. This limits the ability to manage crop health efficiently and sustainably.

### `Existing Approaches`

Various mechanical and semi-automated spraying systems have been introduced to reduce manual labor in agriculture. Tractor-mounted sprayers and handheld machines improve coverage but still follow a uniform spraying logic, treating all plants equally regardless of their condition.

Some modern solutions incorporate basic camera or sensor-based detection to identify infected plants. While these systems improve disease identification compared to manual methods, they generally focus only on detecting the presence of infection. The same treatment is applied irrespective of whether the infection is minor or severe.

Many of these solutions are also expensive, bulky, and designed for large-scale farming. Their high cost, maintenance requirements, and operational complexity make them unsuitable for small and medium-scale farmers. In addition, most systems function as standalone units and do not provide meaningful monitoring or feedback to farmers.

### `Prior Art Overview`

Several agricultural robots and automated sprayers have demonstrated the feasibility of mobile pesticide application in farm environments. These systems are capable of navigating crop rows and spraying pesticides based on predefined conditions or visual input. However, they generally apply a uniform treatment approach and lack selective spraying logic.

Other prior systems focus on automation or remote-controlled spraying mechanisms but do not integrate soil health considerations or farmer-facing monitoring tools. In most cases, farmers do not receive detailed insights about crop condition or soil status, limiting the practical usefulness of these systems in daily farming operations.

### `Identified Gaps`

Based on the review of existing agricultural practices and available pesticide spraying systems, several key gaps can be identified. Most current methods rely on uniform pesticide spraying without considering the actual condition or severity of infection in individual plants, which leads to unnecessary chemical usage on healthy crops. There is also limited focus on monitoring soil health during the spraying process, even though soil quality directly affects crop growth and long-term farm productivity. In addition, many existing solutions are costly, complex to operate, and difficult to maintain, making them impractical for small and medium-scale farmers. The absence of farmer-oriented monitoring and feedback further reduces their effectiveness, as farmers do not receive timely or actionable information to support better decision-making. These gaps highlight the need for a more precise, affordable, and farmer-friendly pesticide application approach that promotes selective treatment and sustainable farming practices.
